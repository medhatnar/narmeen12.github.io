## About

Narmin is a mythical Pok√©mon of South America and Middle Eastern decent which had been thought extinct. A growing number of people have seen her recently. She is a pokemon that can learn any new technology. She Reacts to actions with seamless component changes. If that doesn't work, she can hit you at any Angular version since she is always listening. With her swift attack she never misses deadlines.
